# Next App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) **v15** project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and has the following features preconfigured:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) integration
- Preconfigured [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) setup with switching between light and dark mode.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) **v4**
- Containerize the application using Docker

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm set-up
```

The above command executes the `setup.sh` script to set up the project by:

- Ensuring [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) are installed globally.
- Installing all dependencies.
- Building the app for the first time.

You can now start the development server by running:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Update Dependencies

[npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) is an excellent tool for detecting the latest versions of dependencies and updating them in your `package.json`. It simplifies the process of keeping your project up to date with the latest package versions.

### Installation

The `setup.sh` script globally installs **npm-check-updates**.

To update packages while also understanding the impact of the changes, run:

```bash
pnpm check-updates
```
This groups updates by type (**major**, **minor**, **patch**), making it easier to assess potential risks before upgrading.

Update all dependencies && check build status after updating all packages:

```bash
pnpm install-updates && pnpm build
```
